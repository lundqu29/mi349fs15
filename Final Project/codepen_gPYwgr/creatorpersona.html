    <p>One of the greatest things about YouTube is, if you love it there's almost definitely a video about it! Any hobby, sport, music or topic you can find a video about it. Often times those videos lead to a larger community. These communities are what make up the YouTube genres. Some of the most common are Vloggers, people who document their lives. Beauty Gurus, who make makeup, hair and other beauty tips and tutorials. Gamers, who record themselves playing video games for entertainment and insight into the game. DIY or Do it yourself, who make instructional videos on who to make, fix or do really anything at all. The list goes on and on, those are just some of the popular topics.  
</p>
<p> These genres often are broken down into smaller communities within communities. I recently learned that there are motorcycle vloggers who vlog their day through a gopro on their helmet. That is a unique community many would not think of. The point is, just be yourself and find your niche. That's one of the best things about YouTube, your ability to connect with people all over the world based on common interests. It makes this giant world feel a little smaller.</p>

YouTube consists of billions of users and millions of content creators. It's easy to feel small or lost in the crowd in the YouTube community. In order to not just blend in, you need to brand yourself. You want a catchy and memorable name. You want a channel design, logo or slogan. Often times YouTube channels become their own brand. Try to sway away from common channel names or names with numbers in it.
<br> <p>Another way to brand yourself is to take advantage of other social media outlets. Using sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and more can help you network as well as create a larger online social presence which can only grow your channel more. </p>
